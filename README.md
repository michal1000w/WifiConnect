# WifiConnect
Simple shell script to connect to wifi using terminal.
I wrote this script due to bug in network-manager on Kali linux which made connecting to wifi imppossible.
To run this:
1. copy WifiConnect.sh on your computer
2. open terminal in folder with WifiConnect.sh
3. write chmod +x WifiConnect.sh
4. ./WifiConnect.sh

UPDATE!!! In WifiConnect2.0.sh I've added support for other card names than wlan0
